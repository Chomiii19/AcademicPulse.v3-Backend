# AcademicPulse

This project has multiple features such as ID Validation through QR code, entry and exit campus validation using the QR code also, and a dashboard where you can check the students' log and ID validation statistics. <br />
This project was specifically meant to cater IDs from Technological University of the Philippines - Manila. <br />

You can access the app live [<u>here</u>](https://academicpulse.onrender.com). <br />

**If you plan to use this for either school or personal projects be sure to the following things:** <br />
ðŸ‘‰An ID must have a QR Code (if not you can just generate one) <br />
ðŸ‘‰The value within the QR Code must have a standard format and must be unique (e.g. A student's ID have a qr code value when scanned of "TUPM-XX-XXXX") <br />
ðŸ‘‰Replace the validation of the code using your QR code value format. <br />

**Steps to use the app:** <br />
ðŸ‘‰**Student Record Feature**: Upload the student records. You can either change the schema of the model or follow it (Admin level users can only access this). <br />
ðŸ‘‰**ID Validation Feature**: The app will check if the student is enrolled (is in the uploaded student record) and validates the ID by scanning the QR Code. <br />
ðŸ‘‰**Campus Gate Pass Feature**: The app can be used to scan a student's ID if it is validated. If not, a student must get validated first before entering the campus (Student's entry and exit logs are also saved). <br />
ðŸ‘‰**Campus Dashboard Feature**: Shows the dashboard of students' entry and exit logs, ID validation statistics, ratio of enrolled students vs validated enrolled students, and more. (Admin level users only) <br />
